EXERCISE 1
In SQL, JOINs are employed to combine rows from multiple tables by using a common column between them.
Here are some examples of SQL;
1)INNER JOIN-It gives us only the rows where the values match in both tables.


 SELECT orders.student_id, students.student_name
 FROM orders
 INNER JOIN students ON orders.student_id = students.student_id;
2)LEFT JOIN- Retrieves all rows from the left table along with any matching rows from the right table. If there's no match, the right table columns display NULL values.



SELECT students.students_name, orders.order_id
FROM students
LEFT JOIN orders ON students.student_id = orders.student_id;

3)RIGHT JOIN- Retrieves all rows from the right table along with any matching rows from the right table. If there's no match, the right table columns display NULL values.

SELECT students.students_name, orders.order_id
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN orders ON students.student_id = orders.student_id;

EXERCISE 2
In SQL, we use the ALTER TABLE statement to change how a table is set up.

ADD COLUMN
ALTER TABLE students
ADD name VARCHAR(255);

MODIFY
To change how a column is defined in a table, we use the ALTER TABLE statement along with the MODIFY COLUMN clause.

ALTER TABLE students
MODIFY COLUMN tuition-fee DECIMAL(7,2);

DROPPING
To delete a column from a table, we employ the ALTER TABLE statement alongside the DROP COLUMN clause.

ALTER TABLE students
DROP COLUMN name;

EXERCISE 3
Foreign keys in a database table point to the primary key in another table, creating a link between the two tables, which is called a parent-child relationship.
This link helps ensure data consistency, known as referential integrity.

CREATE TABLE author (
    author_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    author_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_name VARCHAR (50),
    author_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES author (author_id)
);

EXERCISE 4
Model-View-Template, which is a design pattern used in Django web development.

The MVT pattern in Django works like this: Models define the data structure.
Views handle the logic and data processing.
Templates generate the HTML pages that users see in their browsers.

EXERCISE 6
Analytical Questions:
- Find the most borrowed book in the last 6 months. (10 ball)

SELECT books.title, COUNT(*) FROM borrowingrecords INNER JOIN books ON
 borrowingrecords.book_id=books.book_id WHERE borrowingrecords.borrow_date
 BETWEEN '2024-01-01' and '2024-06-06' GROUP BY borrowingrecords.book_id, books.book_id
 ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 1;


              title               | count
-----------------------------------+-------
 Former more station here point.   |     6



- Find the member who has borrowed the most books. (10 ball)

SELECT members.name, COUNT(*) FROM borrowingrecords INNER JOIN members ON
borrowingrecords.member_id=members.member_id GROUP BY borrowingrecords.member_id,
members.member_id ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 5;


      name       | count
-----------------+-------
 Timothy Olsen   |    19
 Rebecca Osborne |    19
 Krystal Montoya |    18
 Denise Salas    |    18
 Leslie Carr     |    18
(5 rows)



- Find the average borrowing duration for books. (10 ball)

SELECT AVG(return_date-borrow_date) FROM borrowingrecords WHERE return_date IS NOT NULL;


         avg
----------------------
 366.1310344827586207
(1 row)
